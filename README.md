# ðŸ“˜ Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ§¾ Introduction

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** repository. This project serves as a foundational step in the software development lifecycle by focusing on identifying, documenting, and validating the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system.

The objective of this repository is to explore and demonstrate best practices in:
- Defining user needs and system expectations
- Translating use cases into detailed requirements
- Creating visual models such as Use Case Diagrams, Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), and Flowcharts
- Structuring user stories and feature specifications for backend development

This repository is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and aims to strengthen your ability to approach real-world project planning and analysis with clarity and precision.
