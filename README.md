# 📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 🧾 Introduction

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** repository. This project serves as a foundational step in the software development lifecycle by focusing on identifying, documenting, and validating the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system.

The objective of this repository is to explore and demonstrate best practices in:
- Defining user needs and system expectations
- Translating use cases into detailed requirements
- Creating visual models such as Use Case Diagrams, Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), and Flowcharts
- Structuring user stories and feature specifications for backend development

This repository is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and aims to strengthen your ability to approach real-world project planning and analysis with clarity and precision.

## 📌 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software system. It is one of the most critical phases of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it lays the foundation for all future development activities.

### 🎯 Key Objectives of Requirement Analysis:
- Understand the business needs and goals.
- Define the scope of the software project clearly.
- Identify the system’s functional and non-functional requirements.
- Detect potential conflicts or inconsistencies early.
- Translate user expectations into actionable technical specifications.

### 🧠 Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):

| Benefit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ **Clarity & Alignment** | Ensures developers and stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the system should do. |
| 💸 **Cost Efficiency** | Prevents costly revisions later by uncovering problems early in the project. |
| 🧪 **Testability** | Defines clear requirements that can be used to develop acceptance criteria and test cases. |
| 🛠️ **Project Planning** | Provides the necessary input for estimating timelines, effort, and resources. |
| 📈 **Project Success** | Reduces ambiguity and scope creep, increasing the chances of successful and timely delivery. |

---

### 🔍 Types of Requirements:
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system should do (e.g., user login, property booking).
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: How the system should perform (e.g., performance, security, usability).
- **Business Requirements**: High-level goals of the organization or product.
- **Technical Requirements**: Platform, tools, and technical constraints.

---

By conducting thorough requirement analysis, teams can ensure that software products are aligned with user needs, feasible to implement, and maintainable over time.

## ❗ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a crucial role in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. Without a clear understanding of what needs to be built, development efforts can easily go off track, leading to wasted time, cost overruns, and failed projects.

Here are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is essential:

---

### 1. ✅ Ensures Clear Communication and Alignment

It bridges the gap between stakeholders (clients, users) and developers by defining precise and unambiguous requirements. This helps everyone involved to align their expectations, reducing the risk of misunderstandings and scope creep.

---

### 2. 💸 Saves Time and Reduces Costs

Identifying potential issues, missing features, or conflicting requirements early in the project is far more cost-effective than fixing them later during development or after deployment. Requirement analysis minimizes rework by getting things right from the beginning.

---

### 3. 📐 Forms the Foundation for Design and Testing

All design decisions, system architecture, and testing procedures stem from well-defined requirements. Functional and non-functional requirements serve as the benchmark for system validation and acceptance criteria, guiding both implementation and quality assurance.

---

By investing time in requirement analysis, software teams can ensure they build the right product — efficiently, effectively, and with fewer surprises during the development process.

## 🧩 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves a series of structured activities to ensure that the final product aligns with stakeholder needs and business goals. Below are the five key activities in this process:

---

- **📥 Requirement Gathering**
  - Collect raw requirements from stakeholders, users, clients, and subject matter experts.
  - Techniques include interviews, questionnaires, surveys, and market analysis.

- **🔍 Requirement Elicitation**
  - Actively explore and clarify requirements by engaging stakeholders.
  - Uses methods such as brainstorming, workshops, observation, and use case analysis to uncover hidden or implicit needs.

- **📝 Requirement Documentation**
  - Record the gathered and elicited requirements in a clear and structured format.
  - Common outputs include Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, and functional requirement documents.

- **📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
  - Analyze the documented requirements to identify gaps, conflicts, or ambiguities.
  - Create models and diagrams (e.g., use case diagrams, data flow diagrams) to visualize system behavior and interactions.

- **✅ Requirement Validation**
  - Confirm that the documented requirements are complete, consistent, and feasible.
  - Includes reviews, walkthroughs, and validation meetings with stakeholders to ensure approval before development begins.

---

These activities are often iterative and collaborative, helping teams deliver software that truly meets user expectations and business objectives.

## 🧾 Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are generally categorized into two types: **Functional** and **Non-functional**. Both are essential to ensure that the system behaves correctly and meets user expectations.

---

### ✅ Functional Requirements

**Definition**: Functional requirements define **what the system should do**. They describe the specific behaviors, functions, and features the system must support.

**Examples for the Booking Management Project**:
- A guest must be able to **search for available properties** based on location and dates.
- The system should **prevent double bookings** by validating date overlaps.
- A user must be able to **create a booking request** and **receive a confirmation notification**.
- The host should be able to **view and manage booking requests** for their listed properties.
- Guests should be able to **cancel bookings** based on the host’s cancellation policy.

---

### 🛡️ Non-functional Requirements

**Definition**: Non-functional requirements specify **how the system should behave**. They focus on performance, usability, scalability, security, and other quality attributes.

**Examples for the Booking Management Project**:
- The booking confirmation response time should be **under 2 seconds**.
- The system should be able to **handle up to 10,000 concurrent booking requests**.
- All user data must be **encrypted at rest and in transit**.
- The platform should have **99.9% uptime** to ensure availability for global users.
- The booking interface should be **mobile-responsive and accessible** across different devices.

---

Understanding and documenting both types of requirements ensures that the system is **both functional and user-friendly**, supporting a robust and reliable user experience.

---

## 🧩 Use Case Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** are a type of behavioral diagram used in software engineering to represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system. These diagrams visually map out the system's functionality from the user's perspective, showing what the system does and who interacts with it.

They are part of the **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** and are especially useful during the requirement analysis phase.

---

### 📈 Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- **User-Centric Perspective**: Helps developers and stakeholders understand how users will interact with the system.
- **Scope Clarification**: Defines what features are in-scope and what is out-of-scope.
- **Improved Communication**: Serves as a communication bridge between business users and technical teams.
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensures all user goals are addressed before design and development begin.
- **Visual Simplicity**: Offers a clear and easy-to-understand visual representation of complex interactions.

---

Use Case Diagrams are particularly effective in early stages of development, such as for the **Airbnb Clone** project, where understanding **who does what** (e.g., guests booking properties, hosts managing listings) is critical for building accurate system requirements.
